# CloudMigrationTool

This is a .NET tool with a GUI made with Avalonia to migrate your files from one cloud provider to another. This tool provides a "Core" assembly that you can depend on to develop your own provider for the tool to use and migrate.

# Status

Very Early development. Still unusable in its current state.
